The appetite may sicken, and so die.
That strain again! it had a dying fall:
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
But falls into abatement and low price,

And water once a day her chamber round
With eye-offending brine: all this to season
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
And lasting in her sad remembrance.",1221,18704

To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft

She sat like patience on a monument,

Much in our vows, but little in our love.",1238,18712

their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
She that would alter services with thee,
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
postscript.
[Reads]
'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'

everything that thou wilt have me.",728,18713

'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the

limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous

Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love, without retention or restraint,
All his in dedication; for his sake
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
Into the danger of this adverse town;
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before.",116,18721

That screws me from my true place in your favour,
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,

631805,2350,"After him I love
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above
Punish my life for tainting of my love!",1238,18721
631806,2355,"Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!",836,18721
631807,2356,"Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?",1238,18721
631808,2357,"Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Call forth the holy father.",836,18721
631809,2359,"Come, away!",840,18721
631810,2360,"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.",836,18721
631811,2361,Husband!,840,18721
631812,2362,"Ay, husband: can he that deny?",836,18721
631813,2363,"Her husband, sirrah!",840,18721
631814,2364,"No, my lord, not I.",1238,18721
631815,2365,"Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
As great as that thou fear'st.
[Enter Priest]
O, welcome, father!
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
Here to unfold, though lately we intended
To keep in darkness what occasion now
Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.",836,18721
631816,2377,"A contract of eternal bond of love,
Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
Attested by the holy close of lips,
Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
And all the ceremony of this compact
Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
I have travell'd but two hours.",913,18721
631817,2385,"O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.",840,18721
631818,2391,"My lord, I do protest--",1238,18721
631819,2392,"O, do not swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.",836,18721
631820,2394,"[Enter SIR ANDREW]",1261,18721
631821,2395,"For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
to Sir Toby.",60,18721
631822,2397,"What's the matter?",836,18721
631823,2398,"He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.",60,18721
631824,2401,"Who has done this, Sir Andrew?",836,18721
631825,2402,"The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.",60,18721
631826,2404,"My gentleman, Cesario?",840,18721
631827,2405,"'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
by Sir Toby.",60,18721
631828,2408,"Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
You drew your sword upon me without cause;
But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.",1238,18721
631829,2411,"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown]
Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
but if he had not been in drink, he would have
tickled you othergates than he did.",60,18721
631830,2417,"How now, gentleman! how is't with you?",840,18721
631831,2418,"That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?",159,18721
631832,2420,"O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
were set at eight i' the morning.",401,18721
631833,2422,"Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
hate a drunken rogue.",159,18721
631834,2424,"Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?",836,18721
631835,2425,"I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.",60,18721
631836,2426,"Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!",159,18721
631837,2428,"Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.",836,18721
631838,2429,"[Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]",1261,18721
631839,2430,"[Enter SEBASTIAN]",1261,18721
631840,2431,"I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
But, had it been the brother of my blood,
I must have done no less with wit and safety.
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
I do perceive it hath offended you:
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago.",976,18721
631841,2438,"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
A natural perspective, that is and is not!",840,18721
631842,2440,"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
Since I have lost thee!",976,18721
631843,2443,"Sebastian are you?",116,18721
631844,2444,"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?",976,18721
631845,2445,"How have you made division of yourself?
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?",116,18721
631846,2448,"Most wonderful!",836,18721
631847,2449,"Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
Of here and every where. I had a sister,
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman? what name? what parentage?",976,18721
631848,2455,"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
So went he suited to his watery tomb:
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us.",1238,18721
631849,2460,"A spirit I am indeed;
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate.
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'",976,18721
631850,2466,"My father had a mole upon his brow.",1238,18721
631851,2467,"And so had mine.",976,18721
631852,2468,"And died that day when Viola from her birth
Had number'd thirteen years.",1238,18721
631853,2470,"O, that record is lively in my soul!
He finished indeed his mortal act
That day that made my sister thirteen years.",976,18721
631854,2473,"If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
That I am Viola: which to confirm,
I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
I was preserved to serve this noble count.
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord.",1238,18721
631855,2483,"[To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid;
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.",976,18721
631856,2488,"Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
[To VIOLA]
Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.",840,18721
631857,2494,"And all those sayings will I overswear;
And those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night.",1238,18721
631858,2498,"Give me thy hand;
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.",840,18721
631859,2500,"The captain that did bring me first on shore
Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.",1238,18721
631860,2504,"He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
And yet, alas, now I remember me,
They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
[Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
How does he, sirrah?",836,18721
631861,2511,"Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
so it skills not much when they are delivered.",401,18721
631862,2516,"Open't, and read it.",836,18721
