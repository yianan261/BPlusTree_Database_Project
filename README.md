# Database Project

This is a C++ project of a relational database using the B+Tree Indexing algorithm to efficiently retrieve key value storage.

# Project Milestone 1

Implemented the B Plus Tree Algorithm in BPlusTreeFull.cpp and defining the skeleton structure of the BPlusTree and node files.

# To Run The Program

## Windows

Run

```bash
g++ \*.cpp -o output
```

then run

```bash
./output
```

## Mac

Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 \*.cpp -o output
```

then run

```bash
./output
```

The program will prompt the user to enter their key value pairs to demonstrate the simulation of how the database indexing works.
